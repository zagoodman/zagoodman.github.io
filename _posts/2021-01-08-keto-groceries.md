Below are foods that can be part of a well-formulated ketogenic diet.

Important! The dose matters. Some "keto" foods can wreck your ketone production if you go overboard. Be especially wary of products that market themselves as "keto friendly" yet contain sugar.

Be careful with higher protein foods (especially meats) - keto is *not* a high protein diet! As a rule of thumb, I try to stick to >70% of calories from fat and <10% from carbohydrate and <20% from protein.

## Produce
- Asparagus
- Avocado
- Bell pepper
