Diet matters – we all know that. What we don’t know is which diet enables us to perform at our best (though it probably involves more vegetables and less fast food). What is best for us depends on our goals. For me, I want my diet to:

1. Improve long-distance triathlon performance
2. Improve cognitive performance

Goals aside, I have no interest in increased performance if it comes with incessant [hanger](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hangry) and feeling deprived, and I’m not willing to sacrifice long term health for short term performance. So my diet faces two constraints:

3. No hanger or otherwise negative
4. Not worsen longevity (biomarker proxies) relative to baseline

Most of the dietary interventions that satisfy the above are well known, such as abstaining from alcohol and tobacco and reducing added sugar consumption. If you're reading this, I assume you've already done the 20% that captures 80% of the benefit, and you're interested in more marginal gains. If so, read on.

In this article I describe the Cyclical Ketogenic Diet (CKD), why it may help, and how I implemented it. It short, the CKD:
- alternates between a high-fat diet and a whatever-you-want diet
- may improve endurance and cognitive performance and longevity while maintaining sanity
- is not particularly challenging to follow, though it's not a cheap diet

## What is it? ##

The CKD alternates between a ketogenic ("keto") diet and a whatever-you-want diet ("refeed") diet. If you've been active online in the past few years, you've probably heard of keto, but just in case, it is a high fat, low carbohydrate, and moderate protein diet. A typical cycle is usually one refeed day every week or two, though the "ideal" cycle interval will vary by person depending on biology, training, psyche, etc.

The two states of the diet are about as different as could be. While following keto, one mainly consumes fat, allowing the body to deplete itself of stored glucose (glycogen). As the glycogen levels fall, the body increasingly relies on fat as its primary fuel source, eventually entering ketosis. On the other hand, refeeding generally involves high levels of carbohydrates that replenish the body's depleted glycogen stores and turn off ketosis. The influx of carbohydrates carries with it several downstream effects including increased levels of hormones that help with muscle growth and repair and ultimately performance.

## What is ketosis? ##

Ketosis is a metabolic adaptation that Mother Nature programmed into our DNA to help humans (and our mammalian ancestors) survive starvation. In ketosis, the body saves its little remaining glycogen by using predominantly fat as fuel. Some fat, either from food or stores in the body, is converted in the liver to _ketone bodies_, the chemicals Acetone, Acetoacetic acid, and Beta-hydroxybutyric acid, that can be consumed by your muscles and organs for energy in lieu of glucose. Presence of ketones in the blood at elevated levels is the gold-standard test for ketosis.

One does not have to starve themselves to enter ketosis. Unlike starvation ketosis, nutritional ketosis can be achieved following a carefully formulated diet, namely one that leaves the body depleted of glucose. The exact macronutrient composition depends on the individual and their activity levels, though a rough guide for a moderately active person is under 10% calories from non-fibrous carbohydrates, under 20% from protein, and over 70% from fat.

## Why would you cut carbs as an endurance athlete? ##

Short answer: you can become a bonk-proof endurance machine.

Conventional wisdom says that endurance athletes should pile on the carbs. I want to be clear that the conventional wisdom _is right_ in many, but not all cases. Take, for example, the Tour de France, which is one of the most grueling endurance races on the planet. Though most of each 5+ hour stage is ridden at a relatively low intensity where keto-adaptation could make sense, the race is ultimately won or lost during periods of high intensity - sprint finishes, and in the mountain stages, steep, punchy climbs. A keto-adapted elite cyclist may very well finish, but not win, the Tour.

Unlike the Tour, Ironman/ultra distance triathlons, many ultramarathons, and most ultracycling events rarely if ever require exercise intensities anywhere close to max effort. These long events, often taking more than ten hours and sometimes spanning multiple days, typically require athletes to sustain a relatively low level of effort (<70% of max heart rate). At these lower intensities, cells produce the bulk of their energy via cellular respiration, which can use glucose or fat as fuel.

### An aside on cellular energy ###

It's been a while since most of us took Biology, so let's recap briefly. The first step to glucose metabolism is called "glycolysis", a chemical reaction that produces pyruvate and 2 ATP molecules (among other biproducts) for each glucose molecule. The pyruvate produced by glycolysis has two potential fates. Under low energy demand (low intensity exercise), the pyruvate will enter the mitochondria where it continues the process of cellular respiration to produce ATP - in total, net of losses, about 32 ATP per molecule of glucose. Under high energy demand, the pyruvate instead becomes lactate, which is shuttled out of the cell to the liver to be restored back to glucose.

You may be thinking "Why the heck would the cell choose to produce lactate and only get 2 ATP per glucose molecule versus a whopping 32 ATP per glucose molecule via cellular respiration?" The answer is because glycolysis is really fast - about 100 times faster than the rate limiting step of cellular respiration. So though it's less efficient and creates an acidic cellular environment, anaerobic glycolysis is the cell's solution to meeting high demands for energy.

How does fat play into cellular power generation? Fatty acids are most commonly metabolized through cellular respiration, just like in glucose metabolism. The key difference is that fatty acids cannot undergo glycolysis. Indeed, the cells do not have a way of getting ATP from fatty acids as quickly as they can from glucose. Hence, fats are not the ideal substrate for high intensity exercise. **When it comes to low-intensity exercise, however, cells can meet nearly all of the energy demand through cellular respiration, which can use glucose or fat as fuel.**

At the cellular level, it shouldn't matter if the Acetyl-CoA that enters the Kreb's Cycle and ultimately produces ATP comes from glucose or fat. But at a macro level, the differences are night and day.

### Newton's Laws in an Ironman ###

All energy expended while exercising came from somewhere, usually from energy stored in the food we consume or the fat we carry. Thanks to power meters and other technology, we can reasonably estimate the total energy expenditure during an Ironman. From there, we can estimate how much food and body fat we would have consumed meeting that energy expenditure.

A person who bikes at 250 watts for one hour "burns" 215 (kilo)calories, if his body were 100% efficient at converting food to power. In practice, our metabolic engines convert only about 25% of consumed potential energy (calories) to mechanical energy while the rest is converted to heat, non-propulsive work (for example, breathing), etc. Hence, that 250 watts for an hour requires about 860 calories of food.

To keep things simple, let's assume this person burns about 800 calories per hour of exercise at Ironman race effort, ~70% of VO2 max. If this person finishes in 10 hours, he will have burned 8,000 calories over the course of the race. To keep things conservative, I'm deliberately not counting calories for basal metabolic rate, but you can imagine that a more realistic model would have the agent burning around 10,000 or more calories over the course of the race.

Where did the 8,000 calories come from? Some came from stored glycogen, some from stored fat, and the rest from food consumed during the race. The relative composition of each looks very different for carb versus fat-adapted athletes.

![FASTER Study](/assets/images/ckd/fasterstudy.png)

From the [FASTER](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049515003340) study, we know that highly-trained fat-adapted athletes burn over 60g of fat per hour of exercise at 70% of VO2 max. Their carb-adapted peers burn less than half of that at the same exercise intensity. I assume athletes start the race with 2,000 calories of stored glycogen and burn 30 or 60 grams of fat per hour (540 vs 270 calories per hour) for carb vs fat-adapted athletes, respectively. To reach 8,000 calories, the carb adapted athlete would have to consume 3,300 calories or 825 grams of carbohydrate over the course of the race. The fat-adapted athlete would only have to consume 600 calories or 150 grams.

82.5g of carbohydrate looks like


### Fat: the unlimited fuel source ###


## Do any pros follow a similar diet? ##



Consider that

 Under low energy demand, cells power themselves primarily through cellular respiration, which takes glucose or fatty acids and ultimately produces ATP in the mitochondria.

 Under high demand for ATP (think sprinting), cells resort to glycolysis, a process in the cytoplasm of the cell that is about 100 times faster than oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria, to produce A TON of ATP. The cost of this fast production? Efficiency. Glycolysis produces only two ATP per molecule of glucose. The slower but much more efficient cellular respiration can produce about 32 ATP per molecule of glucose. Cells rely on cellular respiration until demand for energy exceeds possible output, at which point the



## What is fat adaptation? ##

Fat adapted athletes are adept at turning fat into fuel. The mechanisms involved are beyond the scope of this article, but at a high level, fat adaption involves both the accessing of fat - moving fat from the dietary tract and from storage to the muscle cells and liver - and rate of conversion of fat into ATP.



Most endurance athletes are carb-adapted, that is, glucose

## Why CKD? ##

I became interested in trying a ketogenic diet (KD) after reading a handful of studies involving animal models that demonstrated a causal relationship between [ad-libitum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_libitum#Biology) KDs and reduced prevalence of old-age diseases. Though all the animal models in the world cannot _prove_ that similar results will hold in humans, I can't wait a lifetime until the nutritional epidemiologists can reach some consensus on what we "should" be eating for improved longevity.




Swam 7 miles in the ocean after an overnight fast, biked 50 – 100 miles multiple times without consuming any carbohydrates, and ran a half marathon after consuming only one serving of UCAN Superstarch, all without bonking on any occasion.
3 PM slump is gone, mental fog is nonexistent, and hunger-induced irritability is a thing of the past.
Triglycerides and total:HDL ratio are lower and far below any appreciable level of heart disease risk, blood pressure dropped from borderline high to normal, bodyfat (measured by DEXA scan) is just under 11%.
Typical keto day is 4,000+ calories of satisfying meals, snacks, and dessert – tonight’s was chocolate mousse with coconut and macadamias.
